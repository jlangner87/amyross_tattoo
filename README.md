### **_Description_**

#### I am a coffee connoisseur. I love it. I need it.

#### I particularly enjoy filling my bean hopper with unique small batch roasts from independently owned roasteries. The problem is that they are difficult to find. They are typically buried under the large corporate operations with massive advertisement budgets.

### **_Technologies Used_**

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- React.JS

---

### Key Learning
- Use of [react-slideshow-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slideshow-image): This React component is a time efficient way to produce custom image slideshows in a react application.
-Use of CSS styling to lock scrolling and create a smoothe *"page-turn"* user interface.
